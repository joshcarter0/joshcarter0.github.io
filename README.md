## Exposure and competencies 
**Python**
- I have proficiency and good experience independently, and academically, programming with Python. My favourite peice of work, that I have completed, was my coursework piece for 'Programming and Discrete Mathematics', which involved using classes to create a decryption method (for weak/ traditional encryption methods, e.g. the Ceasar Cipher), using letter frequency analysis. In particular, I enjoyed the freedom and open ended nature of the final question:t improve as you see fit. To this end, I implemented a feature to compare frequencies of small (1-3 letter) words with the most frequently occuring small words, and, in particular, saw a great improvement of the decryption correctly identifying (and subsequently swapping) 'a' and 'i'. Similarly, I increased the functionality by accepting character arrays throughout, where previously only string inputs had been eligible. I was awarded the highest mark for this coursework (90%), and received only comments of commendation for my efforts.
