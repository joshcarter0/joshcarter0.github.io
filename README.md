# Master's in Mathematics student with work experience

## Exposure and competencies 
**Python**
- I have proficiency and good experience independently, and academically, programming with Python. For instance, for my 'Programming and Discrete Mathematics' module, which involved coding classes in Python to create a decryption method using letter frequency analysis (for weak/ traditional encryption, e.g. the Ceasar Cipher). In particular, I enjoyed the freedom and open ended nature of the final question: to improve as seen fit. To this end, I implemented a feature to compare frequencies of small (1-3 letter) words with the most frequently occuring small words and single letters. In particular, this saw a great improvement of the decryption correctly identifying 'a' and 'i'. Similarly, I increased the funcationality by accepting character arrays throughout, where previously only string inputs had been eligible. I was awarded the highest mark for this coursework (90%), and received only comments of commendation.
